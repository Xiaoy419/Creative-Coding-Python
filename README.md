Poem I

The Path

A little rain with a warm breeze
Not afraid of the long way to get to the end

They say difficulties and obstacles
Are just part of the lost journey of life

To whom to tell the laugh, to whom to tell the wound
Is it possible? Is it worth it?

At the moment of looking back
All the stars are guiding the lost
Across the great river of silence
To find your guiding star
